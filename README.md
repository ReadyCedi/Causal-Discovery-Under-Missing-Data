# Causal-Discovery-Under-Missing-Data

This repository contains the code and results for my project in statistics *"Causal Discovery Under Missing Data â€“ A Simulation Study of Common Algorithms"*.
The project evaluates the performance of various causal discovery algorithms under different missingness mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR).
